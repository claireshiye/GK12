    "As the COVID-19 pandemic is still ravaging the world, everyone is trying to stay at home as often as possible to avoid getting infected or infect other people. It is important, therefore, to understand what the COVID-19 data looks like and how to interpret the various data such as daily changes and total cases. Most of these data are shown clearly in what is called **histograms** or **bar charts**. In this tutorial, you will be introduced to what is a histogram or bar chart, why a histogram or bar chart is useful and how to use them. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the computational programming language _**Python**_ to draw histograms or bar charts. Don't worry, you don't need to know Python in advance, this tutorial will also introduce you to simple Python programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the tutorial, you will be able to use real data to plot your own COVID-19 cases for your selected counties, states or across the US."

    "## What is a Histogram or Bar Chart?\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply speaking, a histogram shows how a sample of number distributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, below is a figure of a histogram showing different frequencies for different arrival times of some event. From the figure, it is very easily seen that most of people arrive at around 4 mins since the reception started.   \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"histogram_data/hist_sample.png\" alt=\"Hist example from Wikipedia\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Bar charts look similar to histograms but are different. The differences are that bar charts have spaces between the bins and bar charts usually are used to visualize <font color='darkorange'>_**seperate**_</font> catagories such as countries, colors, names etc. Below is an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"histogram_data/barchart_sample.png\" alt=\"Bar example from Wikipedia\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "A set of data can be shown in both histograms and bar charts, and they highlight different aspects of the data. Bar charts hightlight the differences between different bins representing different catagories, but do not show the general distributions of the data. Histograms highlight the distribution of the data but hide the catagory infomation so it is hard to tell which bin corresponds to which catagory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both bar charts and histograms are very useful in visualizing otherwise entangled data. In the following examples and practice, you will see more clearly how to use them and their differences."
